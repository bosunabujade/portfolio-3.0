            <p>
                My Introduction to coding happened in college through a required course called Writing in Electronic
                Environment. Through this course, I was introduced to HTML and CSS and while I did not know it at
                the time fell I in love with coding. It was one of the few courses I took, where I found myself
                completing the assignments well before the due date and even attempting to go above and beyond the
                requirements. <br><br>

                Then in 2020 two years later my friend wanted to start a traveling itinerary business and need to
                build a website. However, she is not at all tech-savvy, so I offered to help her create it. She
                hosted her site on Squarespace and I was able to create a site that she loved, and I was also able
                to rediscover my love of coding. <br><br>

                One thing that I found when creating her website was the limitations that hosting on a web builder
                site could have, this encouraged me to look into learning how to build one from scratch and maybe
                freelance as a web developer. I quickly found that freelancing was not for me and through my
                research I was able to find Skillcrush and start my path to becoming a developer.
