                <p>
                    My Introduction to coding happened in college through a required course called Writing in Electronic
                    Environment. Through this course, I was introduced to HTML and CSS and while I did not notice it at
                    the time fell in love with coding. It was one of the few courses I took, where I found myself
                    completing the assignments well before the due date and even attempting to go above and beyond the
                    requirements. <br><br>

                    Then in 2020 two years later my friend wanted to start a traveling itinerary business and need to
                    build a website. However, she is not at all tech-savvy, so I offered to help her create it. She
                    hosted her site on Squarespace and I was able to create a site that she loved, and I was also able
                    to rediscover my love of coding. <br><br>

                    One thing that I found when creating her website was the limitations that hosting on a web builder
                    site could have, this encouraged me to look into learning how to build one from scratch and maybe
                    freelance as a web developer. I quickly found that freelancing was not for me and through my
                    research I was able to find Skillcrush and start my path to becoming a developer.
